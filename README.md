What a mess.  
- Older lightstrips will use a 6-pin, 1,5mm pitch, single-row connector from the control box to the strip. It's a Molex Pico-Spox: https://www.digikey.de/product-detail/de/molex/0874390600/WM2090-ND/561769  
- The strip itself has a pretty much standard pin header connector. Except for the pitch, which is 2mm.
